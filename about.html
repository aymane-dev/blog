        <p>
          My name is Jonathan. So a little about myself, I was born in Hollis, Queens NY and I lived in New York till I was about 12 years old. Then my parents decided to move to Florida since it would be safer then New York. I lived in Florida till I was about 22 then I decided with my fiance to move to Austin.

          I am an Aquarius. I like things to be chill and relaxed. I have 2 dogs a Lab/Aussie mix and a pit/boxer mix. Both dogs are awesome one is super relaxed and the other is just really special in that type of way. I am married and have been living in Austin for a little over 7 years now. I am now taking a class to become a web developer.
