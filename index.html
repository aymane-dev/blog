			<h2>How this class feels for now</h2>
				<p>
					So far this class is pretty rad. My instructors are pretty laid back. I am hoping I will be a lot better at creating websites. Hopefully get a job as a web developer or move over to a web developer position at my job at <a href="http://www.journeyed.com">JourneyEd.com.</a>
				</p>
        

            
			<h2>Places I would like to visit.</h2>	
      <p>
        I have been to a couple of places in the US and abroad but I would love to visit more of my family in France and Trinidad. I would love to visit Alaska. Being out in the outdoors with the cold weather. I am planning on taking a trip out to Portland, Oregan. I think the pacific northwest is a beautiful area and I would like to live in a cooler climate.
      </p>
        <h2>Getting the blog started</h2>
        <p>I have been going around and trying out different stuff to work on with the blog. I feel like I need something more on the page to fill up the white space. Hopefully as the class progresses this blog will look better and better.</p>
